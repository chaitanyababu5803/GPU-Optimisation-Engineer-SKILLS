GPU-Optimisation-Engineer-SKILLS & programming
To become a GPU Optimization Engineer, you must master a blend of low-level systems programming, deep hardware knowledge, and performance-profiling methodologies. 
Core Programming Languages
C / C++: The primary languages for high-performance computing. Proficiency in modern C++ (C++17/20), template meta-programming, and RAII is essential for managing memory and hardware interfaces.
Python: Used for developing front-end DSLs, automation, and AI framework integration (e.g., PyTorch, JAX).
Assembly (PTX/GCN): Understanding low-level instruction sets and writing inline assembly or intrinsics is often required for extreme kernel tuning. 

GPU-Specific Frameworks & APIs 
NVIDIA Stack: Expertise in CUDA is the industry standard. Advanced developers also use CUTLASS for linear algebra and Triton for Python-based kernel development.
AMD Stack: Knowledge of HIP and the ROCm ecosystem is critical for performance roles targeting AMD hardware.
Vendor-Neutral/Cross-Platform: Familiarity with OpenCL, SYCL, or OpenACC is highly valued in high-performance computing (HPC). 

Technical Optimization Skills
Architecture Knowledge: You must understand memory hierarchies (registers, L1/L2, shared memory/LDS) and execution models like warps and occupancy.
Kernel Tuning: Ability to optimize GEMM (General Matrix Multiplication), Flash Attention, and memory-bound operations by minimizing latency and maximizing bandwidth.
Compiler Optimization: Experience with MLIR, LLVM, and lowering pipelines for GPU code generation.
Performance Profiling: Mastery of tools like NVIDIA Nsight, rocprof, and PyTorch Profiler to identify bottlenecks. 

Math & Algorithms
Linear Algebra: Deep understanding of numerical methods and matrix operations used in deep learning.
Parallel Algorithms: Implementing tiling, vectorization, and coalesced memory access patterns. 

Are you focusing on AI/Deep Learning optimization (e.g., LLMs) or Graphics/Rendering optimization (e.g., game engines)?
